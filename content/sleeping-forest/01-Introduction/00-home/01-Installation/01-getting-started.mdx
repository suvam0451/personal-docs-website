This module will guide you through installing and configuring the extension.
It is assumed that you have a working copy of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
or [VSCode Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).

If you had any trouble setting those up, please read through here first.

### Step 1: Installation

---

#### From store

The extension is now updated via the extension store. You can search for `Sleeping Forest` and get it.
It will be updated regularly, so **read changelogs for updates**. In it, there will be API changes, links to updated documentations and feature showcases.

![auto install](../../../../images/sleeping-forest/01-Introduction/storeinstall.png)

#### From VSIX file

You can install nightly builds from from [CI outputs](https://gitlab.com/suvam0451/sleeping-forest-ue4/pipelines/) as well.

The option to manually install an extension can be found from the extensions tab as shown below

![sidebar](../../../../images/DaedalusAPI/introduction-module/001.png)

After selecting the `.vsix` file, you might be asked to restart your editor.
Do so and then you can find the extension listed along any other extensions which can be accessed from the sidebar as shown below.

![manual install](../../../../images/sleeping-forest/01-Introduction/manualinstall.png)

### Step 2: Basic Configuration (Programming)

---

Fire up the project using the `.code-workspace` file.
_(always use that to start the project)_.

Run `UE4 : Inject Workspace definitions in Workspace file` from the command palette. _(Ctrl + Shift + P in windows)_

This will make the following changes:

- Inject configs into your `.code-workspace` to **improve intellisense**.
- Get you **better search results**
- **Add modding files** as a workspace folder under UE4.

The new workspace file should look like the following.

![Custom config applied](../../../../images/DaedalusAPI/introduction-module/004.png)

Your new sidebar should look like the following (minus the asset stream folders.)

![new sidebar](../../../../images/sleeping-forest/01-Introduction/newsidebar.png)

Restart the editor.

NOTE : **Everytime you regenerate project files**, run this command to get configs, modfiles and asset streams.
Then restart editor for all configs be applied _(Shortcut --> (Ctrl +R))_.

Next up, get started with the following key features of the extension

1. [Context keys](/docs/sleeping-forest/context-keys/) Context bindings
2. [Snippets](/docs/sleeping-forest/snippets-overview) Snippet Library
3. [CLI tools]() Command line tools
4. **Commandlets** : Individual callable functions and features. **_Listed in sidebar_**.

### Step 3: Basic Configuration (Asset Management)

---

No coding proficiency is required for using the asset management tools. The concept of **asset stream** targets
any single folder with your raw files {fbx, music, art} and applies a lot of optimization on them
{image compression, duplicate detection}.

It then **generates JSON data** for each _asset type_ and _each folder_. This is especially powerful for
data driven gameplay since your **assets are automatically imported** and instead of plugging assets manually,
you can use one of the JSON files to do so.

This is meant to extend to procedural level design systems and dialogue systems etc.,
where classes in your engine would ask for data tables instead of asset references.

Following links will guide you through setting up and configuring your first **Asset Stream**.

2. [Importing basic assets](/docs/sleeping-forest/importing-asset-streams)
3. [Configuring your import](/docs/sleeping-forest/importing-asset-streams)
4. [Packing textures before importing](/docs/sleeping-forest/asset-stream-texture-sets)

### Step 4: Customizing modules

Most modules of this extension are written in a modular fashion.
They all use JSON files as rules to provide you awesome functionalities.

This means, you can write add own rules on top of what the developer or the sommunity puts up.

1. [N/A] Extending the context keybound auto-completions
2. [Extending the headerpacks](/docs/sleeping-forest/extending-header-packs)
3. [/docs/sleeping-forest/extending-the-buildspace] Adding your custom class generator
4. Don't forget to share new findings with the community

### Step 5: Technical details

The following devlogs cover how I am going about making this plug-in.
I am also sharing a few open-source tools that are made to be usable cross-engine.
All of them are being used as part of this extension.

1. High level npm package for applying smart edits in c based languages
2. Asset pipeline tool written in go.

My motivation for writing this extension was I always found automating tasks exciting.
I want to make games with system driven gameplay and true player agency with active consequences.
However, the sheer amount of learning, motivation and expertise kept it out of reach.

Developing games should be a fun learning process and I will use whatever programming expertise
I have garnered in the past couple of years to bring you powerful tools that let you focus on making awesome games.

See you later... üñê
