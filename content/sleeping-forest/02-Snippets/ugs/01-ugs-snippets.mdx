This namespace contains snippets and commandlets to let us interact with
the **_UGameplayStatics_** class, **_DataTables_**, **_AssetRegistry_**, **_Asynchronous asset loading_**.

---

### Method list

---

For example, getting assets from asset/plugin folders in C++.
The following is the full list.

| Code                | What it generates |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| ugs_objectfind      |                   |
| ugs_classfind       |                   |
| ugs_subsys_gameinst |                   |

### Associated classes

---

- GampleplayStatics has gameplay utility functions. [UE4 Wiki](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/Kismet/UGameplayStatics/index.html)
- Subsystems are used to make game-specific GameInstances. _(Game instances persist across levels and are useful for storing state information while switching levels.)_ [UE4 Wiki](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Subsystems/index.html)

### Advice/Alternatives

---

This section has some general advice about usage of few of the classes/functions generated by the codes above.
Sometimes there migth be better ways to do things and I will list them here.

This part is not important to use the extension. Feel free to skip.

#### ugs_objectfind

Used to load assets by path in C++ code. Try not to load assets directly in C++ like this. Having EditAnywhere (Or even better, fully data-driven) is better.

That said, this is useful when loading textures for UI etc.

```cpp
static ConstructorHelpers::FObjectFinder<${3:UStaticMesh}> ${1:UniqueName}(TEXT("/Game/$2"));
if(${1:UniqueName} != null) {
    ${4:TargetObject} = ${1:UniqueName}.Object;
}
```

#### ugs_classfind

Used to load classes**_(One of few ways to load BP classes into C++)_**.

```cpp
static ConstructorHelpers::FClassFinder<${3:ParentClass}> ${1:UniqueName}(TEXT("/Game/$2"));
if(${1:UniqueName} != null) {
    ${4:TargetSubClassOf} = ${1:UniqueName}.Class;
}
```
