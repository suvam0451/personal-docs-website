## UProp Snippet/Commandlet namespace

This namespace automates generation of variable declaration requiring UPROPERTY() macros.
You may fall back to respective **_Comamndlets_** if your intellisense suddenly stops responding.

It is recommended to remove any conflicting snippet provider and follow my preferences guide for more responsiveness.

<Alert
	head="Invocation Tradeoff"
	body="Unlike snippets, If you use Commandlets, missing headers are automatically injected."
/>

**_The cursor position at end (\$0) automatically positions you to fire up your next snippet/commandlet._**

### Fundamentals

Although not the most useful, uprop and uprop_ro are exposed when you need complete control on type.

#### uprop

This lets you dictate the type and name of the function. Do note that a UPROPERTY with BlueprintReadWrite will throw error if not a **public:** field.

- **\$1**: mention type and name of property.
- **\$2**: Helpful comment

```cpp
	// ${2:Description not provided}
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Parameters")
		$1;
```

#### uprop_ro

Same as uprop but not editable by user

```cpp
	// ${2:Description not provided}
	UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Parameters")
		$1;
```

---

### Specific declarations

These are more specific. Respective commandlets will inject headers, if missing.

#### uprop_mesh

---

```cpp
	// ${2:Description not provided}
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Parameters")
		UStaticMesh *$1;
```

#### uprop_switch (uimpl_switch)

A boolean parameter defaulting to false, intended to be used like a button by designer.
See XYZ for implementation of the trick. Category is changed to _Triggers_.

- **\$1**: mention name of property.
- **\$2**: Your comment

```cpp
	// ${2:Toggle back to false(when user presses) in OnConstruction to use as a trigger}
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Triggers")
		bool $1 = false;
```

It can be quickly associated in source(.cpp) file using `uinit_switch` from `uinit` namespace.

```cpp
// This function may be private
void ARandomizedWallActor::OnConstruction(const FTransform &Transform)
{
	// ${2:CallbackFunction is a public function}
	($1 == true) ? {$2:CallbackFunction()} : ($1 = false);

	// For example, (Switch == true) ? CallbackFunction() : (Switch = false);
	// CallbackFunction can update your actor/component on demand.
}
```

#### uprop_ismc

Adds a property of type UInstancedStaticMeshComponent.
All about how ISMC can be used for preuso-procedural generation can be found in [this](/tutorials/ue4/instanced-static-meshes/1) tutorial series
A boolean parameter defaulting to false, intended to be used like a button by designer. See XYZ for implementation of the trick.

- **\$1**: mention name of property.
- **\$2**: Your comment

```cpp
	// ${2:Description not provided}
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Parameters")
		UInstancedStaticMeshComponent *$1;
```

#### uprop_mesh

Adds a StaticMesh property (Not recommended, see AssetRef and Asynchronous Asset loading for better resource management tutorials)

```cpp
    // ${2:Description not provided}
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Parameters")
    	TMap<int, UStaticMesh*> $1;
```

**_Use-cases_**: You can see SM map usage here. You will also see potential issues that might come up.

---

### Rich declarations

Specific case declaration of maps, arrays, significant types which are difficult to type straight.
This is where the module shines

#### uprop_ismc_map

Adds a property mapping

```cpp
    // Description not provided
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Parameters")
    	TMap<int, UInstancedStaticMeshComponent*> ;
```

**_Use-cases_**: Used in procedural workflows to instantiate ISMC.

<Alert
	head="Why not use TArray ?"
	body="If 1/5 reference was missing, an array would miss the last element regardless. Can't map two maps without map."
