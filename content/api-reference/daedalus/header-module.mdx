## Header manager module

The header manager is there to help in quickly resolving include dependencies.

- Run `Daedalus: Include Headers` commandlet and select a package to include headers.
- No duplicates are produced. Feel free to spam.
- Many of our commandlets will use this internally.
- This means dependencies are auto-resolved if you use commandlets primarily.

**_This commandlet throws warning unless run from a valid header(.h) file_**

In reality, this being a niche project, you can't find literally every subset of headers you might use.
If you want to modify packages, you can join the community and suggest improvements and features.

Following are the headers includes for each option as of **v0.8beta**.

##### Gameplay Systems

```cpp
#include "Kismet/GameplayStatics.h"
#include "Engine/DataTable.h"
```

##### Splines

```cpp
#include "Components/SplineMeshComponent.h"
#include "Components/SplineComponent.h"
```

##### ISMC

```cpp
#include "Components/InstancedStaticMeshComponent.h"
```

#### Issues / Future Upgrades / Proposals

- Headers in source file is not considered. This is preventing forward declaration.
- PCH files(for those who still use them) are not considered.
