In this page, I will tell you a bit about where Visual Studio Code extensions are stored
and which files you need for extending the extension
This should help you find the JSON files used to add your mods.

However, **this guide will be for windows only**. I have no idea where they are stored in MacOS/Linux.
Any pointers towards that would be appreciated.

### Installation Location

---

After adding an extension, the files can be found in

- **C:/Users/{Username}/.vscode** for Visual Studio Code
- **C:/Users/{Username}/.vscode-insiders** for Visual Studio Code Insiders

You would be interested in the following folders

#### 1. Snippets

---

Browse this to view the snippets.
If a large number of snippets were added and the documentation was not updates,
here's where you'll find them.

#### 2. out/data

---

This folder contains the default JSON files that ship with the extension. **You don't want to modify these**,
unless you have a hang of how the API works.

#### 3. out/data/extensions

---

This folder contains files that are available to you to add your templates.
For a comprehensive guide on the various modules available for modding and how-tos, follow these links
