#### Introduction

Instanced static meshes can be used in place of normal static meshes to save drawcalls significantly. Most importantly, please note the following:

- `ISMC` is Instanced Static Mesh component. It is a component to which a mesh can be allocated.
  Now, this mesh can be duplicated with carying transforms(rotations and locations) with no extra rendering cost.
- `ISM` will stand for Instanced Static Mesh. It is a single instance produced by the component.

Wikipedia : In real-time computer graphics, **_geometry instancing_** is the practice of rendering multiple copies of the same mesh in a scene at once. For our purposes:

- We can have as many mesh instances as we want.
