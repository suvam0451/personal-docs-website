## uprop snippets

In this section, we will be adding various UPROPERTY() through property macros. The sample will be demonstrated using an actor.

If you had any trouble setting those up, please read through here first.

### base uprop snippets

---

The base line of macros are called using `uprop_xyz`.
They carry the { **VisibleAnywhere**, **BlueprintReaDWrite** } macros.
Below example shows two such snippets being inserted. Notice the 3-4 seconds delay while intellisense parses the new variable.

I have a throttled i7 8th gen laptop and had 80 mozilla tabs open. You would obviously get faster responses.

### uprop_adv snippets

---

The `uprop_adv_xyz` line of macros replace **EditAnywhere** with **VisibleAnywhere**,
making them hidden from designer view without dropdown.

### uprop_ro snippets

---

The `uprop_ro_xyz` line of snippets have { **VisibleAnywhere**, **AdvancedDisplay**, **BlueprintReadWrite**}
macros. This makes them accessible through a dropdown in editor. It also prevents edit through left editor panel.
Hoever, modification in blueprints is still allowed

### uprop array/map snippets

---

In some cases, a map of components is required to dynamically add/remove components

The option to manually install an extension can be found from the extensions tab in the
sidebar as shown below

After selecting the `.vsix` file, you might be asked to restart your editor.
Do so and then you can find the extension listed along any other extensions which can be accessed from the sidebar as shown below

### Step 2.1: Basic Configuration (Programming)

---

I will assume that you already have a `.code-workspace` file in your project directory.
Keep in mind to start the workspace using that file _(Avoid right click --> Open with VSCode)_

The very first thing to do is to run `UE4 : Inject Workspace definitions in Workspace file` from the command palette.

This will inject a lot of config options into your `.code-workspace` that willimprove your intellisense parsing.
The new workspace file should look like the following.

Restart the editor. Everytime you regenerate the project, run the same command again to get the configs.
You have to restart the editor once after running command for all configs to be applied properly.

### Step 2.2: Basic Configuration (Asset Management)

---

For using the asset management tools, no C++ is required. Following links will guide you through setting up and configuring your first **Asset Stream**.

See you later... üñê
