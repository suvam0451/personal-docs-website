### Legal

---

**Q. To what extent does MPL-v2 license limit my usage of the extension ?**

You can use the extension **for free, personal, or commercial project**. There is frankly no restrictions in that sense.
All I want is to restrict monetization of modified versions **of my code**. So, no limits if you are a normal user.
You **can't make money from mods** you make. (You **can internally share** modifed version within team/group ).
Also, you can't change the license if you fork the project. It should be always free for everyone.

**tl;dr**: Unlike libraries, It's a fully featured service. I just want to avoid exploits.

**Q. Is this extension free ? What are funding plans ?**

Yes and always will be. Although I would probably charge for a heavily customized build.

**Q. Do I have to credit you or your code ?**

**No**. Appreciated, though. Use it and help me make it better. That's it.
Same does not apply when redistributing.
Please link back to the original website/repo.

### Performance

---

**Q. Provide an honest estimate of genaral performance**

Intellisense dies for six seconds because I have 50 chrome tabs open on my i5 8th gen laptop under battery.
Electron has it's own limits. **Except a delay of 2-4 secs after adding props**.
**Expect a delay of upto 10secs after adding multiple headers**
Other stuff like startup, compile are godspeed.

**Q. Provide an honest estimate of performance in comparision to VS**

I would switch to VS when exploring new language classes like AI and gameplay ability due to well designed navigation.
VSCode is a text editor and it makes me **spend more time analyzing/planning than typing**.

**Q. I still have poor performance with the extension installed.**

Ans. The extension doesn't guarantee a magical improvement in VSCode. That said,
please go through this guide to properly setting VSCode. High chances are your set-up might be the reason.
It **should not** be that bad.

**Q. Very poor performance of VSCode in general, even with my extension.**

I don't claim VSCode to be the best code editor in the programming world.
Emacs already got that honor.
A fucking operating system in a text editor is legendary.

...All I ask if a fair chance.
