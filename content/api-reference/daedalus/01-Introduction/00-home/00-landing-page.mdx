#### Background

Unreal engine 4 always has been a macro-heavy engine.
Moreover, due to the sheer number of classes in the engine, the intellisense fails to keep up.

Another issue around accessibility to the engine _was_ the lengthy parsing times of Visual Studio 2017.
I remember tinkering with build files just to squeeze a bit of performance back when I had an old laptop.
Since then, a lot of improvements have been made to reduce wait times, but _(at least to many)_ the most exciting
quality of life improvement was the addition of support for VSCode as an IDE which shipped with 4.18.

However, it never saw mainstream adoption. It was probably due to stigma around Electron being RAM heavy or intellisense failing to parse files reliably for UE4.
All that is true due to obvious reasons, BUT... what is also true is VSCode has been THE go-to editor for scripting languages(lua, typescript), extension devs(chrome, firefox)
due to **the debugger** and **community support**.

With many engines incorporating C# and python support in last decade and Epic rumored to be on its way to add a new scripting language and import tools for Blender,
I thought it would be pretty cool to have a single swiss-army-knife kind of platform and VSCode fit the bill.

I started development of this plugin late January 2020. It still lacks many classes _(that I am not experienced enough to tackle)_. It does not have replication.

But if you are starting out, learning unreal, or don't mind a few missing auto-completion classes, I urge you to give this extension a try, tell your friends about it,
maybe support me as a developer, or just hang out at my Discord.
I look forward to hearing your feedback...

**More technical Q & A here**

#### Module List

##### **Snippets**

There are 10+ snippet files provided in the extension covering various which are designed to work in various contexts.

1.  **uprop** : Used in header files to add properties and functions (along-with macros). Alternative macros for editor visible/invisible, function BPImplementable/Native/UFUnction/No-Macro
2.  **uinit** : Code portions to initialize components. Useful if you often find yourself looking on docs why your component is invisible/not destroyed/causing leaks
3.  **udebug** : Draw debug shapes. (with FPS variations to get smooth debug experience)
4.  **ugs** : ObjectFinder, ClassFinder, AssetRegistry and all that blueprint-c++ interop stuff. ( Module separate because reading BP/.uasset directly in C++ is tricky/risky )
5.  **custom** : So, how may times have you retyped NewObject, CreateDefaultSubobject UE_LOG() ?
6.  **Add your own** : No replication, no worries. Give me snippets and I'll add them. That way everybody wins.

##### AssetStreams

A framework to have the same file structure across multiple projects. If you store your assets in cloud drive and start a new projects from scratch every new moon, this, my friend, is the tool for you.
It basically lets you create special folders with an "Assets" folder in them. On demand, the folder is read and data about all the assets in extracted to a json file. It also creates a python import script.

Now, with one line of code in UE4, you get your assets from multiple folders with multiple configs.

Note: Original motive was to skip manually setting ue4 to NOT generate materials when I import FBX. More often than not, material instances should be the way to go.

1. Creating sset AssetStreams
2. Maintaining folder references in VSCode
3. Requesting updates after new batch of assets are added
4. Importing assets to UE4
5. Implementation details (Extra)

##### Coding Commandlets

This subsection of commandlets allow you to add functions, manage headers etc. while in VSCode. This means it is all about text editor manipulations.

---

##### UE4 Commandlets

This subsection of commandlets allow you to run unreal engine specific tasks vis command line

1. Compiling shaders !!!
2. Compiling code
3. Compiling game (No custom config yet)

---

##### Error Wiki [WIP]

Allows you to search your C++ errors right from the output logs. C++ errors are usually incomprehensible but after debugging it for the nth time, you get used to it.
I am planning to **tie a search engine API** alongwith a compiled list of **_incomprehensible errors and how to fix them_** from my side to be of help to other devs.

This is a feature in consideration. I will get it to it after fulfilling other modules upto release standards.

##### Better Intellisense

There are a few commandlets which write instructions to your .code-workspace file when called. If you want more control, settings are exposes to your needs. Following are the changes that are made by default :

- Saved, Intermediate are excluded from workspace
- FeaturePacks, Samples, Templates are removed from workspace
- Engine/{Binaries, Build, Contents, DDC, Docs, Extras} are removed from workspace
- .exe, .dll, .so files are excluded
- Entire Engine folder is excluded from watch (they are readonly, but you might want this off for source builds)

Intellisense in VSCode is inferior to VS2019. No doubt. But with a few config adjustment and responsible use of extensions,
it's pretty damn good. More on that here.
