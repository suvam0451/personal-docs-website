In this series, we will write a plugin for Unreal Engine 4 in rust programming language from start to finish. Steps would include

- **(Part-1)** C++ FFI, UE4 plug-in structure _(with third party dependencies)_, Short notes, Viability
- **(Part-2)** Rust-C++ interop (How is data passed between), Market shipping _(lib vs dll)_
- **(Part-3)** Engine Integration, Testing

#### Introduction

---

The main takeaway is that C++ and rust allow static linking. This means we won't have to ship our library(DLL) along-side the game i.e- It will be built into the executable. This is important for procedurally generating world during runtime in shipped game.
If you only need world building in editor itself, perhaps this would be a better read for you.

Regardless, this series focuses on writing the module in rust, exposed as a third party **.lib**. We will be testing our functionalities outside the editor.
I have previously covered C++ for this. You can find that series below. If you already read that, you can skip any part you already know.

	body="This is useful to write procedural plug-ins (mostly calculation parts). You can write achieve the same with C++ as well."

#### C++ FFI

---

Without delving into technicalities, FFI(Foreign function interface) is used to run compiled code written in one language from another.
For our purpose, C++ uses FFI of C, which effectively means we would have to expose a C header for our functionalities written and compiled in rust.
We will use **cbindgen** for this purpose.

The first and foremost thing to consider writing a gamedev plug-in is the extensibility.
We want the ability to add/modify modules quickly while meeting the desired performance standard.
Rust is a pretty good option for this due to various reasons. Since you are here, you may have heard of few.

#### UE4 plug-in structure

Every plugin has the following structure.
